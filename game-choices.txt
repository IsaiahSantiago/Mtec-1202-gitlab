My first choice is Pongs located at ` https://pippinbarr.com/pongs/ ` , This is a compilation of several unique or base versions of Pong with fun minigames or changes to gameplay. The game follows the simple premise of you against another player in local Co-Op attempting to score more than the other player and vice versa, every game mode offers the same way to win albeit with a few exceptions yet it stays fair between both players, the formula itself is just bouncing a ball between two paddles and trying to get the ball to go past the left or right side of the screen to score. 

The second game is Meerkattica playable at ‘ https://excaliburjs.com/ludum-48/ ’, this game shares similar controls to another game I know known as dig dug with the player being able to dig and traverse through the dirt in order to reach the end of the level where the player is rewarded with a cutscene before continuing where more and more obstacles will now be in the way as well as newer potential enemies apart from the large mechanical snake following your trail thus making a tense time based gameplay loop. The game doesn’t have a timer yet the big snake that follows the player which is an instant lose upon touching or being touched and though there are other creatures in the beginning they cannot harm the player. 

The third game was Dashy Golf found and playable on Itch.io at ‘ https://triqui.itch.io/dashy-golf ’, the game’s genre leans towards puzzle with a unique win lose system being that winning is punting the golf ball in the hole in the least amount of moves between all levels and the loss condition is if you accidentally soft lock your progress by moving puzzle pieces in the stages in a way that halts your progression therefore forcing you to restart or give up on the game entirely. The benefit of the controls is that it can use both the WASD keys and the arrow keys allowing you to use whichever hand is the most dominant.
