My first choice is Pongs located at ` https://pippinbarr.com/pongs/ ` , This is a compilation of several unique or base versions of Pong with fun minigames or changes to gameplay. The game follows the simple premise of you against another player in local Co-Op attempting to score more than the other player and vice versa, every game mode offers the same way to win albeit with a few exceptions yet it stays fair between both players, the formula itself is just bouncing a ball between two paddles and trying to get the ball to go past the left or right side of the screen to score.
